module Proxy::Dynflow
  module Runner
    # This module expects to be included into a Runner action, where it can be
    # used to simplify handling of long-running processes. However it tracks the
    # running process as a group of instance variables, which has served us
    # reasonably well in the past, but can be rather error prone.
    #
    # A better alternative to this is
    # {::Proxy::Dynflow::Runner::ProcessManagerCommand}. It tracks the whole
    # execution of a process under a single instance variable and uses a more
    # robust {::Proxy::Dynflow::ProcessManager} under the hood. It also
    # maintains the same interface and can be used as a drop-in replacement.
    #
    # This module is now soft-deprecated and
    # {::Proxy::Dynflow::Runner::ProcessManagerCommand} should be used instead.
