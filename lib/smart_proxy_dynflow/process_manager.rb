module Proxy
  module Dynflow
    # An abstraction for managing local processes.
    #
    # It can be used to:
    # - spawn a local process
    # - track its lifecycle
    # - communicate with it through its standard input, output and error
    # - step through the execution one event at a time or start the child process and wait until it finishes
    #
    # @example Run date command and collect its output
    #   pm = ProcessManager.new('date')
    #   pm.run!
    #   pm.status #=> 0
    #   pm.stdout.to_s.chomp #=> "Thu Feb  3 04:27:42 PM CET 2022"
    #
    # @example Run a shell loop, outputting all the lines it generates
    #   pm = ProcessManager.new(['/bin/sh', '-c', 'for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; sleep 1; done'])
    #   pm.on_stdout { |data| puts data; '' }
    #   pm.run!
    #   #=> 1
    #   #=> 2
    #   #=> 3
    #
    # @example Run bc (calculator) interactively and count down from 10 to 0
    #   pm = ProcessManager.new('bc')
    #   pm.on_stdout do |data|
    #     if data.match?(/^\d+/)
    #       n = data.to_i
    #       if n.zero?
    #         pm.stdin.to_io.close
    #       else
    #         pm.stdin.add_data("#{n} - 1\n")
    #       end
    #     end
    #     data
    #   end
    #   pm.stdin.add_data("10\n")
    #   pm.run!
    #   pm.stdout.to_s.lines #=. ["10\n", "9\n", "8\n", "7\n", "6\n", "5\n", "4\n", "3\n", "2\n", "1\n", "0\n"]
